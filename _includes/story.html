                  In the summer of 2012,
                  Kevin and Catherine both logged onto OkCupid.com and matched with each other.
                  Kevin reached out to say hello, and Catherine, emboldened by her incredible trip with friends to San Diego Comic Con,
                  kept messaging back and forth with this cute guy (who even had an adorable dimple!), in hopes of scoring
                  a date. She eagerly told Kevin about her adventures at SDCC, where she had cosplayed as Wonder Woman
                  and the Hulk. Eventually, Kevin finally asked the question Cat was hoping for:
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted text-quote">"Would this Hulk like to go out to dinner with me?"</p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                  After their first date at Brennan's during Houston Restaurant Week, Kevin and Catherine got to know each other as
                  they started a relationship. For example, Catherine learned that Kevin lives and breathes basketball.
                  Every weekend, he jumps out of bed for basketball
                  in the morning with his friends and at night, cheers on the Houston Rockets. When he is not playing basketball,
                  Kevin often games online with his friends and brings out his stellar Cantonese cooking skills in the kitchen.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                  As for Catherine, she had recently switched to martial arts after spending many years in dance. Besides kicking
                  butts and getting her own butt kicked, Cat enjoys gardening, sewing, crafting the occasional cosplay, and cuddling with
                  guinea pigs, her spirit animal.

                  As a couple, Kevin and Catherine enjoy traveling - scenic hikes for Kevin and Hogwarts or sandy beaches for Cat. At home, they
                  like trying out new places to eat and watching anime together. Their recent favorites are One Punch Man, Attack on Titan,
                  and My Hero Academia.

                  In early 2019, Kevin took Catherine on a trip to Belize, where he proposed. After 7 years of dating, a house,
                  and three guinea pigs, Kevin and Catherine are ready to tie the knot and hope you can join them as they start
                  the next chapter in their lives!
